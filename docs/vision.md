# Vision for this project

I want to create an all in one system for online course provision. You know the type - Influencers selling courses, usually sold in range of $100-$1000, or a recurring subscription. There is absolutely not a centralised, premium feel platform for managing this as most of them work off a combination of platforms not well managed together. This platform aims to provide the whole experience for those users, from leads and sales to course provision.
